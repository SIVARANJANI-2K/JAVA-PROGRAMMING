In a small village near the coast
Hannah sat by the lake gazing at the clear reflection of the sky As the sun set
the villagers gathered to listen to their leader a wise man named Bob hello
who told tales of distant lands
Level headed people like us must rise above the chaos
he said Hannah nodded feeling a sense of calm as she noticed the stars slowly emerging
The night was serene and even the rare sight of a radar blinking far in the distance couldn't disturb the peace
madam malayalam bhjegh ufeu
hello why pip why
